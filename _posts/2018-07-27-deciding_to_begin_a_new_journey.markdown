Programming to me is an outlet and the best form of human expression. I have decided to take this a journeyman's path to develop systems, interfaces and data applications that allow me to carry out some of my most pertinent career goals of building a fully autonomous trading and portfolio management system.

Since closing my social search startup, I have sought to find synergy in my diverse skill sets. This has led me to the intersection of finance and technology, specifically, to become a Quantitative Portfolio Manager. 

Upon beginning my journey, things were very daunting. Could I do it? Was I too far behind academically, mathematically? Many thoughts had gained real estate in my mind, but the energy I felt upon seeing a trading algorithm in action, I knew this was it and I had to gain the neccessary know how.

No matter the journey ahead, I have endeavered to find that the best resources to not only develop faculty with quantitative analysis, but  to the best automate my entire workflow from data pipeline to execution. The thought of not only constructing models and trading signals, but the ability to automate all areas of my trading continually proves to be the best use of my career as the physic income is unparalled. If i'm lucky, hopefully the financial rewards will be as prudent. No matter the outcome, I see the financial markets as the olympics for the worlds brightest brains and for me the last meritocracy left for those willing to leap the great barriers of knowlegde. One thing for certain, through the challenges and brain stimulation there ceases to be a boring day.

As of now, I feel my skillset has grown tremendously.  I'm sure glad I did not let the mountain of prerquisite subjects deter me. Before beginning Flatiron School I believed I was a solid novice programmer, now I have expanded my skillset to encompass full stack software systems as well as computer science fundamentals. 

In the end of this portion of my learning journey I seek to develop prowess with my abilities to retrieve data, wrangle it, visualize and develop quantitative models. My end product from this stage is to produce full stack systems that assist in my research for trading signals, economic insights, risk management and portfolio analysis. From here I can move onto to complex systems and network programming for optimital trade execution & data transmission in confidence.

My journey to quantamentals is my personal story of a journeyman on a road to compete with passion. I look forward to the path ahead and I am taking this road one step at a time, day by day.

Best,

Michael
