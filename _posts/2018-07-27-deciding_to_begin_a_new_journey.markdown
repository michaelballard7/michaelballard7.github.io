Programming to me is a outlet to a better form of expression, analysis and automation. I have decided to take this journey in order to develop interfaces and data applications that allow me to carry out some of my most pertinent careet functions.

For many years I have sought to become a Quantitative Trader. Upon beginning my journey I had come to find that the best of the best quant not only know how to perform analysis of potential trading strategies, but the best ones can automate there work flow from end to end.

The thought of not only constructing trading signals, but the ability to automate all areas of my trading including research proved to intriguing of opportunity to let pass by.

As of now, I feel my skillset is growing tremendously. Before beginning Flatiron School I was a solid scientific programmer, now I have been expanding my skillset to encompass full stack web systems as well as computer science fundamentals such as data structures, algorithms and design patterns.

End the end of my learning journey I hope utilize my skillset to retrieve data, visualize it and produce web interfaces that assist in my research, trading and interacting with various stakeholders.

I look forward to the path ahead and I am taking things one day at a time.

Best,

Michael
