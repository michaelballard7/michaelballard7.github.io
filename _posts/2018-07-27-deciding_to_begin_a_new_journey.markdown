Programming to me is a outlet to the best form of expression. I have decided to take this a journey to develop interfaces and data applications that allow me to carry out some of my most pertinent career functions.

Since closing my startup, I have sought to find synergy in my diverse skill sets. This has led me to the intersection of finance and technology, specifically, to become a Quantitative Portfolio Manager. 

Upon beginning my journey, things were very daunting. Could I do it? Was I too far behind academically, mathematically? Many thoughts gain real estate in my mind, but the passion I felt upon seeing a trading algorithm in action, I knew this was it.

No matter the journey ahead, I would endeaver  to find that the  best resources to not only develop faculty with quantitative analysis, but  to the best automate my entire workflow from data pipeline to execution. The thought of not only constructing models and trading signals, but the ability to automate all areas of my trading  continually proves to be the best use of my career as the physic income is unparalled. I see the financial markets as the olympics for the worlds brightest brains and for me the last meritocracy left for those willing to leap the great barriers of knowlegde.

As of now, I feel my skillset has grown tremendously.  I'm sure glad I did not let the mountain of prerquisite subject deter me. Before beginning Flatiron School I was a solid scientific programmer, now I have expanded my skillset to encompass full stack software systems as well as computer science fundamentals.

End the end of this learning journey I hope utilize my skillset to retrieve data, visualize it and produce web interfaces that assist in my research, trading and interacting with various stakeholders.

I look forward to the path ahead and I am taking things one day at a time.

Best,

Michael
