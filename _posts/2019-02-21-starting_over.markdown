It has almost been one year since I have relocated back to New York City. I have since attended bootcamps, meetups, taken countless hours of quantitative online courses and I'm finally seeing the  light at the end of the tunnel as I know longer lack clarity if this is the road for me. 

```
def years__to_phd(x):
   years = x
   return "I have #{years} of dedication ahead of me!"
end 
```

My journey has since led me to develop my first trading models and even trade discretionary to feel the intution behind my methods. My execution has not been perfect, but certainly not bad. Overall my learnings have encouraged me, but also reminded me that "Mr. market" is unbiased, rewarding for diligence and hard work.
