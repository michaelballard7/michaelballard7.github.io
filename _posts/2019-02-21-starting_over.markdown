It has almost been one year since I have relocated back to New York City. I have since attended software development immersives, meetups, taken countless hours of math and statitstics online courses. I'm finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and enjoying the plateu to mastery as I no longer lack certainty if this is the road for me.  While my journey has been far from easy, it has been a pleasure to accumulate my knowlegde base outside of the formal academic setting.

My next major goal to achieve over the course of this year is to enter and complete the [Quantitative Methods for Finance Program at Columbia University](http://sps.columbia.edu/certificates/quantitative-studies-for-finance-certificate). This program formalizes my education towards an applied mathematics background with courses ranging from advanced calculus, stochastic processes, linear algebra to numerical methods for optimization and analysis. My end goal for this two year journey is to prepare myself to for the quantitative rigor of Doctorate programs in either Comptational Finance or Financial Economics. I have an early interest in concepts such as Market Design and Macro Finance for potential research topics, however its to early in my journey to opine with certainty.

Some may ask why this way vs obtaining a masters in computer science and moving into industry. To me the answer is simple, I seek to not only implement my strategies optimally, but to objectively interpret academic research whether mathematical, statistical or economic in nature. The skills learned from a Doctoral program will postition me to scientifically  interpret and manipulate models while allowing me to build on my existing skill set to have independent facilitation of the components of quantitative trading, econometric research and statistical modeling.

   years = x
   return "I have #{years} of dedication ahead of me!"
end

My journey has since led me to develop my first trading models and even trade discretionary to feel the intution behind my methods. My execution has not been perfect, as learning complex subject or implementations can certainly come with minor frustrations, but intellectually rewarding none the less.
